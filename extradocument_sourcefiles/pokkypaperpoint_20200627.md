* 這篇 paper 主要有三個重點但其實當作一個也是可以，那就是我需要我需要我需要 paper 讓我看起來假裝有做事但好像其實我真的有做事說不定是我自己各種母湯我也不知道但做為一個每天很多情緒的人之類的圈叉我覺得還是想到什麼就寫什麼儘管是廢話也是要寫不然還真的一個字也寫不出來其實我覺得大多數的 paper 裡的內容可能背後都充斥著我這種廢話。

* There are three key points, but actually can be viewed as one, that is, I need to publish a paper so that it will seem as if I have accomplished something. Maybe I really have accomplished something? Who knows. But, being a very emotional person, I just have to write what I thought, even if the result would be rubbish. Otherwise nothing would be published. After all, most papers are filled as rubbish as well. 

* 第一個重點是我們對 rate equation 做了修正，試圖解釋在 High power 和較高量子數之迴廊模態下的光致激發光譜。在我們原本的理論之中，我們忽略了在較低的功率之下品質因子對 gain coefficient 的影響，而這個假設會在 high power 之下對高量子數之迴廊模態得到不合乎物理現象的模擬頻譜。而在我們這篇 paper 裡頭完整推導了 rate equation 的關係式，並與幾組 high power 的實驗數據互相驗證，而得到更合乎物理直觀的數據結果。

* Back to the "three key points". The first key point is a modification of rate equation that would explain photoluminescence spectra under a high-power, high-quantum number gallery mode. In our original theory that was aimed at emulation of spectra under low-power mode, influence of quality factor (Q factor) on gain coefficient was omitted in the model, which would result in inaccurate emulation under high-power mode. In this paper, the formentioned factor is introduced to the rate equation. This equation was validated with several datasets under high-power mode, and is physically accurate. 

* 第二個重點是 polariton 的效應，原本的理論我們只著重在可見光波段由氧空缺造成的光致激發光譜，在這篇 paper 裡我們特別關注在 UV 波段的光致激發光譜，因為這段光譜會在不同的功率激發之下，因為溫度的不同而有紅移現象。但在近UV 波段，迴廊模態的頻譜位置亦會因為 exciton 與 photon 耦合之 polariton 效應而須考慮折射率之修正，在這篇 paper 裡頭我們會對這部分的修正有完整之理論解釋。

* The second key point is about the effect of polariton. In our original theory, the focus is only on visible light photoluminescence related to oxygen vacancies (VO). In this paper, we switched the focus to ultraviolet(UV) photoluminescence, which have several key differences to visible light counterpart. First, there is marked redshift in UV region when exited with various power and temperature. Moreover, in UV region, the spectral density of gallery mode would be affected by exciton-polariton effect, resulting in mandatory refractive index correction. In this paper we would explain refractive index correction under this situation in detail. 

* 最後一個部分是，我們將在前作中各個物理量對於光致激發光譜所造成之影響詳細闡述，這是為了讓之後的人在應用我們的理論做模擬之時，能夠清楚如何調校這些物理量與實驗值相對應，其重點有 extrinsic quality factor 如何限制 Purcell effect 作用在迴廊模態的增益、光致激發與自激發光之比值、gain coefficient 與 quality factor 之關係如何做物理假設等等。

* The last key point is a detailed explanation to effect of various physical quantities on photoluminescence spectra, so that other researchers can adjust these physical quantities to match laboratory data when emulating. This part includes the following: how extrinsic quality factor restrict the gain of Purcell effect on gallery mode, the ratio of photoluminescence to autoluminescence, relationship between gain coefficient and quality factor, and many others. 

* 以上這些工作據說是為了將來把這個理論推廣致 lasing 的 case 之下… 但我很懷疑到底有多少人會 care 把功率加大到 lasing 這個過程發生了什麼事，通常對許多人來說 Photoluminescence 是一回事， lasing 最好當成另外一回事，不然這樣大家都很難發 paper ，畢竟單一模態的 PL 是不是等於 lasing 這個問題問下去就傷了皇城之內的和氣了，不信你去問那些做奈米雷射的，他們肯定會跟你森77的。

* These works above claim to be a foundation for future application for lasing, but it is curious whether people really care what happens when the power is amplified to lasing level. For many people, photoluminescence is better separated from lasing, or it would become very difficult to get enough publication. Afterall, the question "is a single-mode photoluminescence equal to lasing?" is viewed as very sharp and offensive in this atmosphere, and especially "insulting" to the so called "nanolaser" investigators.
